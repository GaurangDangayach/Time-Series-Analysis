# Time-Series-Analysis
This project was done as a part of course MTH517A : Time Series Analysis under prof. Amit Mitra of IIT Kanpur. This project is the implimentation of the famous pairs trading strategy. The key factor in this strategy is that the stocks should necessarily have a higher
rate of positive correlation or equivalently should be co-integrated.
